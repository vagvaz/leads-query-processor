 * CDYNE�s Demographics� is a neighborhood level segmentation system
 * built using various data sources in one combined database. By classifying
 * all U.S. neighborhoods according to consumers� different stages of
 * life and related income levels, it provides a current, accurate and
 * consistent framework to view customers at a neighborhood level. It
 * enables users to compare customers across their product mix, across
 * time and across their enterprise. With high coverage, Demographix
 * also enables users to see differences in how U.S. neighborhoods spend
 * time and money. This turns raw data about customers into accurate,
 * actionable information.  Use a Licensekey of 0 for testing.
